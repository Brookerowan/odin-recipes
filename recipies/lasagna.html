  <h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Note on the sauce: In this recipe each layer has about 1 cup of meat sauce. If you prefer more sauce in your lasagna, increase the pasta sauce to 48 oz.</li>
   </ul>
  <h5>Time Saving Tip</h5>
    <p>Use fresh lasagna sheets found in the deli area and skip the boiling step! Fresh lasagna doesn't need to be boiled first.</p>
    <p>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut.</p>
    <p>Resting is not required when reheating.</p>
