This project will help put my HTML knowledge to the test. I will be building a basic recipe website.
On the home page, there is a photo and three links to different recipe web pages. On the recipe pages, I've included various titles, lists and photos. I've also included links at the bottom of the page to return to the top of the page and return to the home page.
