    <p></p><h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 300°F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-in pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper, leaving an overhang on all sides.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the crust</strong>: Stir the melted butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir until combined. Press mixture evenly into pan. Bake for 15 minutes while you prepare the filling.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the filling</strong>: Combine the sliced apples, flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Mix until the apples are evenly coated. Set aside.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the Streusel</strong>: Whisk the oats, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour together in a medium bowl. Cut in the chilled butter with a pastrey blender or two forks until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Remove the crust from the oven, and preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
      <li>Tightly layer the apples on top of the warm crust, pressing down. Sprinkle the streusel over the apple mixture and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the streusel is golden brown.</li>
      <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes at room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the salted caramel sauce</strong>: Heat sugar in a medium heavy-duty saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly with a high heat resistant rubber or wooden sppon or spatula. <em>Sugar will form clumps and eventually ment into a thick brown, amber-colored liquid as you stir.</em>
        <p>Once sugar is completely melted, immediately stir in the butter until melted and combined. <em>Be careful, the caramel will bubble rapidly when the butter is added. If you notice the butter seperating or if the sugar clumps up, remove from heat and vigorously wisk to combine again.</em></p>
        <p>After butter has melted and combined with the sugar, cook for 1 minute without stirring.</p>
        <p>Very slowley stir in the heavy cream. After the heavy cream has been added, stop stirring and allow to boil for 1 minute. <em> It will rise as it boils.</em></p></li>
        <p>Remove from heat and stir in the salt. Allow to slightly cool down before using.</p>
       <li> Lift the apple pie bars using the foil from the pan to remove the apple pie bars and drizzle with salted caramel sauce. Cut and enjoy!</li>
